## 👋 About Me

😀 Hi, I'm Elias! I'm a passionate 17-year-old developer from Algeria, North Africa, who loves to create and innovate. 💡 My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and the desire to make a positive impact through code. 

🚀 As a self-taught full-stack developer, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in web development, focusing on modern technologies and best practices. 💻 Despite taking an unconventional path by choosing to focus fully on my tech career, I'm committed to continuous learning and professional growth.

🌱 I'm currently seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the tech industry, where I can contribute my skills while learning from experienced developers. My goal is to grow into a skilled professional who can create meaningful solutions through technology. 🎯
